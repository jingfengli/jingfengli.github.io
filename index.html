<h3><a href="https://github.com/jingfengli/fcMRIModel"> fcMRI model</a></h3>
<p>This is a python implementation of the model described in Honey et.al 2007 PNAS, with expansion to capture both ultra-slow (minutes) and ultra-fast (millisecond) neural dynamics.
</p>
<h3><a href="https://github.com/jingfengli/DigitRecognitionNeuralNetwork"> Digit Recognition Neural Network</a></h3>
<p>The network is initally developed for a graduate school class project

This is a multilayer perceptron used for recognizing handwritten digits. 
Training is fulfilled using back-propagation algorithm. 
I used a popular dataset (‘mnist_all.dat’) comprising of training and testing samples of the different digits is provided in the Midterm folder. Each sample is 28x28 gray scale 8-bit image.

The goal is to address whether one process drives the correlation between two other signals. Ideally, one should extract just the shared (correlated) component, and then using causality analysis (e.g., Granger causality analysis or transfer entropy) to determine whether the process of interest drives that correlated component. Methods extracting the correlated component require a large number of correlated signals as input to operate properly. With small amount of correlated signals, the extracted component will necessarily include a substantial amount of non-correlated signal, regardless of the precise method used. Regression based dependency analysis circumvents the need of extracting the correlated component. It estimates the extent to which regressing out the signal can diminish the correlation.
