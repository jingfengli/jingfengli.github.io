<h2>Free run time distribution</h2>

<p>In part 1, I asked, “Where is the best location for a taxi driver to find a customer?” To answer this, one might look at where customers get in a taxi most often (left panel). However, this does not account for how much competition a taxi driver is subjected to at this location. It is likely that if a location has lots of demand for a taxi ride, lots of taxi drivers will also try to go there, thereby increasing the amount of competition between taxi drivers and making it more difficult for an individual taxi driver to find a customer. <br>
So, instead, I looked at the amount of time between two consecutive hired rides for a taxi driver, as well as the distance the taxi traveled unhired between two consecutive rides. I defined these features as free run time and free run distance. I looked at the free run time and distance at each location (). For a given location, the lower the free run time and free run distance, the better for the taxi driver. <br>
First, I grouped the data based on the driver ID. I sorted all the hired rides from the same driver based on the pick up time. I then computed the free run time and distance as the time and distance difference between two consecutive hired rides.  <br>

Based on the distribution of free run time and distance, a taxi driver is better off staying in Manhattan, suggesting that, even though there is increased competition, there are enough customers there to cancel out the negative effects of that competition.
