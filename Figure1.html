<h2>Free run time distribution</h2>

<p>In part1, I asked where is the best location for a taxi to find a customer. One may look at where customers get on a taxi most often. However, this does not reflect how much competition the taxi driver is subjected to. It is likely that if a place has lots of demand for a taxi ride, lots of taxi drivers will try to go there and increase the amount of competition between taxi drivers, which may make it difficult for a taxi to find a customer. <br>
So, instead, I looked at what is amount of time between two consecutive rides of a taxi driver, and what is the amount distance the taxi traveled between two consecutive rides. I defined them as free run time and free run distance. I looked at the free run time and distance at each location. For a give location, the lower the free run time (warmer color in the figure), lower the free run distance, the better for a taxi driver.<br>
First, I grouped the data based on the drive ID. We sorted all the rides from the same driver based on the pick up time. We then computed the free run time and distance, as the time and distance difference between two consecutive rides. <br>

Based on the distribution of free run time and distance, a taxi drive is better off to stay in Manhattan, suggesting even there are competition, but there are enough customers there to cancel the effect of competition.
