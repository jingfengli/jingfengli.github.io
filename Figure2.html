<h2>Life Style in New York</h2>

<p>Next, I want to identify how taxi ride activity differs by time of day in different areas of New York City. To do so, I used the number of taxi in a given location as a measure for how “active” an area is at a given time of day. First, I counted the number of taxi pickups for each time (window size = 1hr) and for each location, based on GPS data. I then computed a probability distribution as follows: if an individual customer is going to use a taxi within 24 hours, what is the probability the customer will hire a taxi at a given hour during the day. I used this probability distribution to identify a taxi-travel “lifestyle.” <br>
Looking across the whole city, I discovered two extreme life styles, shown in the left panel. 
Red: people increased taxi usage around 10 am, stayed active until 8pm, then gradually decreased activity and reached trough at 6 am. I refer to this as a “lark-like” lifestyle.<br>
Blue: people started to gain activity around 6pm, peaked at 4AM, and sharply decreased at 7AM, staying low until 6pm.  I refer to this as an “owl-like” lifestyle.<br>
I then used the cross-correlation to index how different parts of the city are similar or dissimilar to these two extreme lifestyles (right panel). I used a color map to denote the lifestyle of different parts of New York. <br>
Red areas, such as Manhattan and JFK airport and LGA airport, follow the lark lifestyle. 
Blue areas, such as Brooklyn and Queens, follow the owl lifestyle.
