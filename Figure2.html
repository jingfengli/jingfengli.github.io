In part2, I asked what is the life schedule in different parts of New York city. I used the amount of taxi rides as a proximate for how active the area is. The more taxi rides there, the more active of the people at that location is.  First, we counted the amount of taxi pickups for each time (window size = 1hr) and for each location, based on GPS data. 
From the time courses of the amount of taxi pickups for each location, across the whole city, we discovered two extreme life patterns, showing in the left panel. 
Red: people increased using taxi drives around 10 am, stayed active until 8pm, then gradually decreased activity and reached trough at 6 am.  I refer to it as a lark like life style.
Blue: people started to gain activity around 6pm, and peaked at 4AM, and sharped decreased at 7AM and stay low until 6pm.  I refer to it as an owl-like life style.
We then used the cross-correlation to index how similar different city parts are similar or dissimilar to these two extreme life patterns (right panel). I used to color map to denote the life style of different parts of New York.
